            This website aims to fill the gap in visualization of wildfire images in Azerbaijan. 
            The site was created by ADA University students - Ahmad Huseynli, Turgay Farhadli, Gunel Aliyeva, Sahil Guluzada - and serves to present photos and information about many wildfires in Azerbaijan, along with their locations on the map. 
            In addition, the site's ability to filter photos by region, time, satellite type, etc. provides convenience to users who want to gain information in this field.
            In the header section, below the "About us" title, the dataset can be downloaded as a .zip file, which stores 1 folder and 1 CSV file.
        </p>
